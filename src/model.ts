/**
 * This file defines all of the "data-side" library-like code to model the
 * structure of the game state and the associated "what can move where?" logic.
 *
 * - {@link AstrianChessGame} defines the overarching game logic like whose turn
 *   it is and high-level mutation operations like `movePiece()`.
 * - {@link AstrianChessBoard} outlines the game board and contains the
 *   underlying array data structure that holds the `AstrianChessPiece | null`
 *   data for each square of the chess board.
 * - {@link AstrianChessPlayer} represents a player. This class is predominately
 *   used as a convenience for filtering the complete game's list of pieces into
 *   those piece either owned by said player, captured by said player, or those
 *   currently in-play in service of said player. There are always exactly two
 *   `Player` instances in each game; one `"white"` and one `"black"`.
 * - {@link AstrianChessPiece} represents a piece. It's an abstract base class
 *   that other more specific classes like {@link AstrianChessKing} and
 *   {@link AstrianChessKnight} inherit from. It defines some default methods to
 *   interact with the game hierarchy model but relies on implementations to
 *   define the `getMovements()` method. As an example, the
 *   {@link AstrianChessKnight} class defines just `getMovements()` as `[new
 *   AstrianChessMove(-2), new AstrianChessMove(2)]`. Then the base class
 *   methods can make use of those deltas to narrow that list of possible
 *   movements into `possibleMoves()` (those that are contained on the board)
 *   and then `legalMoves()` (those that don't put you in check etc.).
 * - {@link AstrianChessMove} and {@link AstrianChessPosition} are just wrapper
 *   types around `number` to get stricter type checking on construction and
 *   operations.
 * - {@link AstrianChessColor} is a newtype of `"white" | "black"`.
 *
 * This model makes heavy use of the DOM's `EventTarget` class so that each
 * "node" in the game's hierarchy has the opportunity to listen for different
 * game events like `"capture"` and `"move"`.
 *
 * â„¹ We extend the `EventTarget` class to add event bubbling for non-native
 * targets.
 *
 * Need a refresher on the rules?
 *
 * > Part b in the illustration shows an amusing Astrian analogue of chess. On a
 * > linear board a bishop is meaningless and a queen is the same as a rook, and
 * > so the pieces are limited to kings, knights and rooks. The only rule
 * > modification needed is that a knight moves two cells in either direction
 * > and can jump an intervening piece of either color. If the game is played
 * > rationally, will either White or Black win or will the game end in a draw?
 * > The question is surprisingly tricky to answer.
