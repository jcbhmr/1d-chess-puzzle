# 1D chess puzzle

> Part b in the illustration shows an amusing Astrian analogue of chess. On a linear board a bishop is meaningless and a queen is the same as a rook, and so the pieces are limited to kings, knights and rooks. The only rule modification needed is that a knight moves two cells in either direction and can jump an intervening piece of either color. If the game is played rationally, will either White or Black win or will the game end in a draw? The question is surprisingly tricky to answer.
